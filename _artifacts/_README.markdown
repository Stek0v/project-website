# How to artifact for OpenSearch

Each artifact is represented by an item in a Jekyll collection

By convention, each release is organized into a sub-folder.


## Non-Artifacts
There are things that are included as part of a release that are _not_ considered artifacts:
- Docker Hub links
- Package manager links

As a general rule, if it doesn't change from release to release and isn't hosted by us, it's not an artifact.
