The best way to try out OpenSearch is to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). These steps will setup a two node cluster of OpenSearch plus OpenSearch Dashboards:

1. Download [docker-compose.yml](https://opensearch.org/samples/docker-compose.yml) into your desired directory
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Have a nice coffee while everything is downloading and startup up
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:5601/](http://localhost:5601) for OpenSearch Dashboards
5. Login with the default username (`admin`) and password (`admin`)
